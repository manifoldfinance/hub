Purpose of this document
<a class=anchor href=#purpose-of-this-document>#</a>
</h2>
<p>The point of this document is to explain representation of data in Solidity for
the purposes of locating and decoding it; more specifically, for writing a line
debugger that does such. As such, other information about the type system or
data layout that aren&rsquo;t necessary for that may be skipped; and where location
is not entirely predictable but may be determined by other
systems of the debugger, we may rely on that. See the
<a href=https://docs.soliditylang.org/>Solidity documentation</a> for things not
covered here, particularly the
<a href=https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/types.html>section on types</a>
and the <a href=https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/types.html>ABI specification</a>;
and perhaps also see the <a href=https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf>Ethereum yellow paper</a>.</p>
<p>This document is also primarily only concerned with variables that a user might
define, not special language-defined variables which will typically not be
stored in any of these locations, and so for the most part we will not discuss
these, although we will <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-calldata-in-detail-calldata-multivalue-and-lookup-types-reference-types-the-special-variable-msg-data>make an exception for the special variables <code>msg.data</code>
and <code>msg.sig</code></a>.</p>
<p>Finally this document is only concerned with variables as they exist in the
Solidity language, and not in the underlying implementation; thus we will say
things like &ldquo;calldata cannot directly contain value types&rdquo;, simply because
Solidity will not allow one to declare a calldata variable of value type (the
original value in calldata will always be copied onto the stack before use).
Obviously the value still exists in calldata, but since no variable points
there, it&rsquo;s not our concern.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: This document pertains to <strong>Solidity v0.8.9</strong>, current as of this
writing.</em></p>

Locations: Basics
<a class=anchor href=#locations-basics>#</a>
</h2>
<p><sup>[ <a href=#user-content-contents>∧</a> <em>Back to contents</em> ]</sup></p>
<p>The EVM has a number of locations where data can be stored. We will be
concerned with five of them: The stack, storage, memory, calldata, and code.
(We will ignore returndata. There are also some other &ldquo;special locations&rdquo; that
I will mention briefly in the calldata section but will mostly ignore.)</p>
<p>The stack and storage are made of words (&ldquo;slots&rdquo;), while memory, calldata, and
code are made of bytes; however, we will basically ignore this distinction. We
will, for the stack and storage, conventionally consider the large end of each
word to be the earlier (left) end; and, for the other locations, conventionally
consider the location as divided up into words (&ldquo;slots&rdquo;) of 32 bytes, with the
earlier end of each word being the large end. Or, in other words, everything
is big-endian (or construed as big-endian) unless stated otherwise. With this
convention, we can ignore the distinction between the slot-based locations and
the byte-based locations. (My apologies in advance for the abuse of
terminology that results from this, but I think using this convention here
saves more trouble than it causes.)</p>
<p>(For calldata, we will actually use a slightly different convention, as
<a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-calldata-in-detail-slots-in-calldata-and-the-offset>detailed later</a>,
but you can ignore that for now. We will also occasionally use a different
convention in memory, as <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-memory-in-detail>also detailed later</a>, but you can again ignore that
for now. Also, we will ignore the notion of &ldquo;slots&rdquo; in the case of code.)</p>
<p>Memory (with one exception to be <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-memory-in-detail>described
later</a>) and calldata will
always be accessed through pointers to such; as such, we will only discuss
concrete data layout for storage, the stack, and code, as those are the only
locations we&rsquo;ll access without a pointer (but for the stack we&rsquo;ll mostly rely
on the debugger having other ways of determining location, and for code we&rsquo;ll
rely on other compiler output).</p>

Terminology
<a class=anchor href=#terminology>#</a>
</h3>
<p><sup>[ <a href=#user-content-types-overview>∧</a> <em>Back to Types Overview</em> ]</sup></p>
<p>There are a number of ways of dividing up the types into classes. The system
I&rsquo;ll use here is my own, based on what I think is useful here.</p>
<p>A variable of <em>direct type</em> can, for our purposes, be considered as a value by itself.</p>
<p>A variable of <em>multivalue type</em> holds a fixed number of other element variables,
stored consecutively.</p>
<p>A variable of <em>lookup type</em> holds a number of other element variables not fixed in
advance.</p>
<p>A variable of <em>pointer type</em> holds a reference to another multivalue or lookup
variable to be found elsewhere. They never point to variables of direct type or
other variables of pointer type. (Note that pointers are not, in Solidity, an
actual type separate from that of what they point to, but they&rsquo;re useful to
consider as a separate type here.)</p>
<p>This will be our fourfold division of types. Some other type terminology, as
defined by the language, is useful:</p>
<p>The term <em>reference types</em> refers collectively to multivalue and lookup types.</p>
<p>A <em>static type</em> is either</p>
<ol>
<li>A direct type, or</li>
<li>A multivalue type, all of whose element variables are also of static type.</li>
</ol>
<p>(<em>Remark</em>: In pre-0.5.0 versions of Solidity, when static-length of arrays of
length 0 were allowed, these were automatically static regardless of the base
type, since, after all, there are no element variables.)</p>
<p>A <em>dynamic type</em> is any type that is not static. (Pointers don&rsquo;t fit into this
dichotomy, not being an actual Solidity type.)</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also use the term <em>key types</em> to denote types that can be used as
mapping keys. See the
<a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-lookup-types>section on lookup types</a> for more on
these.</p>
<p>Finally, to avoid confusion with other meanings of the word &ldquo;value&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m going
to speak of &ldquo;keys and elements&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;keys and values&rdquo;; I&rsquo;m going to
consistently speak of &ldquo;elements&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;values&rdquo; or &ldquo;children&rdquo; or
&ldquo;members&rdquo;.</p>
<p><a name=user-content-types-overview-types-and-locations></a></p>
<h3 id=types-and-locations>
Types and locations
<a class=anchor href=#types-and-locations>#</a>
</h3>
<p><sup>[ <a href=#user-content-types-overview>∧</a> <em>Back to Types Overview</em> ]</sup></p>
<p>What types can go in what locations?</p>
<p>The stack can hold only direct types and pointer types.</p>
<p>Directly pointed-to variables living in memory or calldata can only be of
reference type, although their elements, also living in memory or calldata, can
of course also be of direct or pointer type.</p>
<p>Some types are not allowed in calldata, especially if <code>ABIEncoderV2</code> is not
being used; but we will assume it is. Note, though, that circular types are never
allowed in calldata.</p>
<p>Only direct types may go in code as immutables; moreover, variables of type
<code>function external</code> cannot presently go in code this way. (Nor can they go
in memory as immutables, when memory is being used to store immutables.)</p>
<p>In addition, the locations memory and calldata may not hold mappings, which may
go only in storage. (However, structs that <em>contain</em> mappings, or that contain
(possibly multidimensional) arrays of mappings, were allowed in memory prior to
Solidity 0.7.0, though such mappings or arrrays would be omitted from the
struct; see <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-memory-in-detail-memory-lookup-types>the section on
memory</a>
for more detail.)</p>
<p>Storage does not hold pointer types as there is never any reason for it to do
so.</p>
<p>While this is not a type-level concern, it is likely worth noting here that
memory (and no other location) can contain circular structs. Storage can also
contain structs of circular type, but not actual circular structs.</p>
<p>Note that reference types, in Solidity, include the location as part of the type
(with the exception of mappings as it would be unnecessary there); however we
will ignore this from here on out, since if we are talking about a particular
location then obviously we are talking only about types that go in that
location.</p>
<p>The rest of this section will give a brief overview of the various types.
However, one should see the appropriate location sections for more information.
Still, here is a summary table one may use (this also covers some things not
mentioned above):</p>

the type as a whole. Also, immutables in memory have the same restrictions that
they do in code.</p>

Basics of direct types: Packing and padding
<a class=anchor href=#basics-of-direct-types-packing-and-padding>#</a>
</h4>
<p>With regard to direct types, storage is a packed location &ndash; multiple variables
of direct type may share a storage slot, within which each variable only takes
up as much space as it need to; see the table below for information on sizes.
(Note that variables of direct type may not cross word boundaries.)</p>
<p>The stack, memory, calldata, and code, however, are padded locations &ndash; each
variable of direct type always takes up a full slot. (There are two exceptions
to this &ndash; the individual <code>byte</code>s in a <code>bytes</code> or <code>string</code> are packed rather
than padded; and external functions take up <em>two</em> slots on the stack. Both
these will be described in more detail later
(<a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-memory-in-detail-memory-lookup-types>1</a>,
<a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-the-stack-in-detail>2</a>).) The exact method
of padding varies by type, as detailed in <a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-direct-types-table-of-direct-types>the table
below</a>.
Note that immutables have slightly unusual padding, whether stored in code or
memory, as will be detailed later (<a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-code-in-detail-code-direct-types>1</a>, <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-memory-in-detail-memory-direct-types-and-pointer-types>2</a>).</p>
<p>(Again, note that for calldata we are using a somewhat unusual notion of slot;
<a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-calldata-in-detail-slots-in-calldata-and-the-offset>see the calldata
section</a>

<p>Some remarks:</p>
<ol>
<li>As the table states, external functions act a bit oddly on the stack; see the
<a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-the-stack-in-detail-the-stack-direct-types-and-pointer-types>section on the stack</a>
for details.</li>
<li>In Solidity 0.8.8, there is a bug that caused user-defined value types to
always take up one full word in storage, regardless of the size of the
underlying type; they would be padded as if they were being stored in a
padded location.</li>
<li>Prior to Solidity 0.8.9, padding worked a bit differently in code; in code, all types
were zero-padded, even if they would ordinarily be sign-padded. This did not affect
which side they are padded on.</li>
<li>Prior to Solidity 0.8.9, padding also worked a bit differently for immutables
stored in memory during contract construction. In this context, all types
used to be zero-padded on the right, regardless of their usual padding.</li>
<li>Some types are marked with an asterisk regarding their padding. These types
may have incorrect padding while on the stack due to operations that overflow.
Solidity will always restore the correct padding when it is necessary to do so;
however, it will not do this <em>until</em> it is necessary to do so. So, be aware
that on the stack these types may be padded incorrectly.</li>
<li>The <code>ufixedMxN</code> and <code>fixedMxN</code> types are not implemented yet. Their listed
properies are largely inferred based on what we can expect.</li>
<li>Some direct types have aliases; these have not been listed in the above table.
<code>uint</code> and <code>int</code> are aliases for <code>uint256</code> and <code>int256</code>; <code>ufixed</code> and <code>fixed</code>
for <code>ufixed128x18</code> and <code>fixed128x18</code>; and <code>byte</code> for <code>bytes1</code>.</li>
<li>Each direct type&rsquo;s default value is simply whatever value is represented by
a string of all zero bytes, with the one exception of internal functions in
locations other than storage. See <a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-direct-types-representations-of-direct-types>below</a> for more on this.</li>
<li>The <code>N</code> in <code>uintN</code> and <code>intN</code> must be a multiple of 8, from 8 to 256. The
<code>M</code> in <code>ufixedMxN</code> and <code>fixedMxN</code> must be a multiple of 8, from 8 to 256,
while <code>N</code> must be from 0 to 80. The <code>N</code> in <code>bytesN</code> must be from 1 to 32.</li>
<li>Function types are, of course, more complex than just their division into
<code>internal</code> and <code>external</code>; they also have input parameter types, output
parameter types, and mutability modifiers (<code>pure</code>, <code>view</code>, <code>payable</code>).
However, these will not concern us here, and we will ignore them.</li>

<h4 id=representations-of-direct-types>
Representations of direct types
<a class=anchor href=#representations-of-direct-types>#</a>
</h4>
<p><code>uintN</code> is an <code>N</code>-bit binary number (big-endian). The signed variant <code>intN</code>
uses 2&rsquo;s-complement.</p>
<p><code>bytesN</code> is simply a string of <code>N</code> bytes.</p>
<p>Booleans are represented by <code>0</code> for <code>false</code> and <code>1</code> for true; they act like
<code>uint8</code>, just restricted to <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Addresses just act like <code>uint160</code>. Contracts are represented by their underying
addresses.</p>
<p>Enums are represented by integers; the possibility listed first by <code>0</code>, the next
by <code>1</code>, and so forth. An enum type just acts like <code>uintN</code>, where <code>N</code> is the
smallest legal value large enough to accomodate all the possibilities.</p>
<p>Internal functions may be represented in one of two ways. The bottom 4 bytes
represented by the code address (in bytes from the beginning of code) of the
beginning of said function (specifically, the <code>JUMPDEST</code> instruction that
begins it). If the value was set outside a constructor, the 4 bytes above that
will be 0. However, inside a constructor, the 4 bytes above that will instead
be the code address of the function inside the constructor code rather than the
deployed code.</p>
<p>For internal functions, default values are also worth discussing, as in
non-storage locations, they have a nonzero default value. In contracts for
which Solidity deems it necessary, there will be a special designated invalid
function. In Solidity 0.8.0 and later, this function throws a <code>Panic(0x51)</code>;
in earlier versions of Solidity, it uses the <code>INVALID</code> opcode, reverting the
transaction and consuming all available gas.
In versions of Solidity prior to 0.8.0, it has the bytecode <code>0x5bfe</code>; in Solidity
0.8.0 to 0.8.4, it has the bytecode</p>
<pre><code>0x5b7f000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004e487b71600052605160045260246000fd
</code></pre><p>and in Solidity 0.8.5 and later, it is a function that just jumps directly to
a function with the latter bytecode (this jumped-to function may also be identified
by the fact that it is a generated Yul function with name <code>panic_error_0x51</code>).
As mentioned, in all cases, such a function is only included if Solidity
deems it necessary.
The default value for an internal function, then, outside of storage, is to point to
this designated invalid function. In all other respects, these default values
are encoded as above.</p>
<p><em>Remark</em>: Prior to Solidity 0.5.8 (or Solidity 0.4.26, in the 0.4.x line) there
was a bug causing the default value for internal functions to be incorrectly
encoded when it was set in a constructor. It would have 0 for the upper 4
bytes, and would have as the lower 4 bytes what the upper 4 bytes should have
been.</p>
<p>External functions are represented by a 20-byte address and a 4-byte selector;
in locations other than the stack, this consists of first the 20-byte address
and then the 4-byte selector. On the stack, however, it is more complicated.
See the <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-the-stack-in-detail-the-stack-direct-types-and-pointer-types>section on the stack</a> for details.</p>
<p><code>ufixedMxN</code> and <code>fixedMxN</code> are interpreted as follows: If interpreting as a
(<code>M</code>-bit, big-endian) binary number (unsigned or signed as appropriate) would
yield <code>k</code>, the result is interpreted as the rational number <code>k/10**N</code>.</p>
<p>User-defined value types are always backed by another type (see the
<a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-direct-types-table-of-direct-types>table</a>
for which types are allowed in this context). Their representation is the same
as that of the underlying type.</p>
<p><a name=user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-direct-types-presently-unstoreable-functions></a></p>
<h4 id=presently-unstoreable-functions>
Presently unstoreable functions
<a class=anchor href=#presently-unstoreable-functions>#</a>
</h4>
<p>Some legal values of function type presently have no representation and so
cannot be stored in a variable. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>External functions with a specified amount of <code>gas</code> or <code>value</code> attached
(even if that amount is zero).</li>
<li>External functions of libraries &ndash; including library functions declared
<code>public</code> when not in that library &ndash; because there is presently no way to
represent that they should be called with <code>DELEGATECALL</code>, and because they may
accept non-ABI types and thus have no signature according to the ABI
specification. This similarly includes functions created by <code>using ... for ...</code>
directives.</li>
<li>Special functions defined by the language. This means globally available
functions; functions which are members of arrays; functions which are
members of addresses; and functions which are members of external functions.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, the question of how these are presently represented when stored, is that
they are not. (There are other presently unstoreable functions, too, but since
their unstorability is due to other issues, we will not discuss them here.)</p>
<p><a name=user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-multivalue-types></a></p>
<h3 id=overview-of-the-types-multivalue-types>
Overview of the types: Multivalue types
<a class=anchor href=#overview-of-the-types-multivalue-types>#</a>
</h3>
<p><sup>[ <a href=#user-content-types-overview>∧</a> <em>Back to Types Overview</em> ]</sup></p>
<p>The multivalue types are <code>type[n]</code> (here <code>n</code> must be positive), which has <code>n</code>
elements of type <code>type</code>; and the various user-defined <code>struct</code> types, whose
multiple element variables (of which there must be at least one) are as
specified in the appropriate <code>struct</code> definition, and occur in the order
specified there.</p>
<p><em>Remark</em>: Prior to Solidity 0.5.0, it was legal to have <code>type[0]</code> or empty
structs.</p>
<p>Note that it is legal to include a <code>mapping</code> type, or a (possibly
multidimensional) array of mappings, as an element of a <code>struct</code> type; prior to
Solidity 0.7.0, this did <em>not</em> preclude the <code>struct</code> type from being used in
memory (even though, as per the following section, mappings cannot appear in
memory), but rather, the mapping (or array) would be simply omitted in memory.
See the <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-memory-in-detail-memory-lookup-types>memory
section</a>
for more details. Such a struct has always been barred from appearing in
calldata, however.</p>
<p>Also note that circular struct types are allowed, so long as the circularity is
mediated by a lookup type. That is to say, if a struct type <code>T0</code> has a element
type <code>T1</code> which has a element type &mldr; which has a element type <code>Tn</code> with <code>Tn</code>
equal to T0, this is legal only if at least one of the types <code>Ti</code> is a lookup
type. However, such types are allowed only in storage and memory, not
calldata.</p>
<p>The default value for a multivalue type consists of assigning the default value
to each of its element variables.</p>
<p>(There&rsquo;s no table for this section as there would be little point.)</p>
<p><a name=user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-lookup-types></a></p>
<h3 id=overview-of-the-types-lookup-types>
Overview of the types: Lookup types
<a class=anchor href=#overview-of-the-types-lookup-types>#</a>
</h3>
<p><sup>[ <a href=#user-content-types-overview>∧</a> <em>Back to Types Overview</em> ]</sup></p>
<p>The lookup types are <code>type[]</code>; <code>mapping(keyType => elementType)</code>; <code>bytes</code>; and
<code>string</code>.</p>
<p>Dynamic arrays, <code>type[]</code>, have an indefinite number of elements of type <code>type</code>.
Mappings, <code>mapping(keyType => elementType</code>, have an indefinite number of
elements of type <code>elementType</code>. Bytestrings, <code>bytes</code>, have an indefinite number
of elements of type <code>byte</code>.</p>
<p>The type <code>string</code> is something of a special case; strings are UTF-8 encoded to
form a string of bytes, and then that string of bytes is stored exactly as if it
were a <code>bytes</code>. For this reason, we will basically ignore the type <code>string</code>
from here on out; it basically acts exactly like <code>bytes</code>, except that one cannot
meaningfully speak of its elements.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, mappings can go only in storage (but <a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-multivalue-types>see previous
section</a> about mappings in structs).
Only certain types are allowed as key types for mappings; these can roughly
be described as the &ldquo;value types&rdquo; together with <code>string</code> and <code>bytes</code>, but one should see
the appropriate tables to see which <a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-direct-types-table-of-direct-types>direct</a> or
<a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-lookup-types-table-of-lookup-types>lookup</a> types are key types.
Observe that key types may all be meaningfully converted to a string of
bytes.</p>
<p>The default value for a lookup type is for it to be empty. For the particular
case of a <code>type[]</code> in memory, the default value once it has been initialized to
a particular size is for all its elements to have their default value.</p>
<p>The information above is also summarized in the following table.</p>

<h3 id=overview-of-the-types-pointer-types>
Overview of the types: Pointer types
<a class=anchor href=#overview-of-the-types-pointer-types>#</a>
</h3>
<p><sup>[ <a href=#user-content-types-overview>∧</a> <em>Back to Types Overview</em> ]</sup></p>
<p>Pointers usually take up a single word, although some take up two words. See the
appropriate location section for information on pointers to that location
(<a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-memory-in-detail-pointers-to-memory>1</a>,
<a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-calldata-in-detail-pointers-to-calldata>2</a>,
<a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-storage-in-detail-pointers-to-storage>3</a>), but you may find a
<a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-pointer-types-table-of-pointer-types>summarizing table</a> below.</p>
<p>Again, remember that pointers are not, in Solidity, an actual type separate from
that of what they point to, but we&rsquo;re considering them here separately all the
same.</p>
<p>Pointers always either point from the stack to somewhere else, or from one
location to somewhere else in that same location. Pointers never go between
different non-stack locations.</p>
<p>The default value for a memory pointer to a variable of lookup type is <code>0x60</code>,
the null pointer; see the <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-memory-in-detail-pointers-to-memory>section on memory pointers</a> for
more information. Attempting to delete a memory pointer to a variable of
multivalue type instead allocates a new instance of that type, of its default
value, and sets the pointer to point at this, so memory pointers to variables of
multivalue type have no fixed default value.</p>
<p>The default value for a storage pointer is a pointer to the <code>0</code> slot &ndash; beware,
making use of such a pointer <em>can</em> lead to nonsense! Don&rsquo;t do this! (Note that
while it is legal to leave a storage pointer uninitialized, it is not legal to
delete one.)</p>
<p>Calldata pointers don&rsquo;t have a default value; they&rsquo;re never uninitialized and
it&rsquo;s illegal to delete them.</p>

The stack: Direct types and pointer types
<a class=anchor href=#the-stack-direct-types-and-pointer-types>#</a>
</h4>
<p>The stack is, as mentioned above, is a <a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-direct-types-basics-of-direct-types-packing-and-padding>padded
location</a>, so all direct types are
padded to a full word in the manner described in the <a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-direct-types-table-of-direct-types>direct types
table</a>.</p>
<p>There are two special cases that must be noted here, that each take up two words
instead of one. The first special case is that of external functions. An
external function is represented by a 20-byte address and a 4-byte selector;
these are stored in two separate words, with the address in the bottom word and
the selector in the top word. Both these are zero-padded on the <em>left</em>, not the
right <a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-direct-types-table-of-direct-types>like in the other padded locations</a>.</p>
<p>The second two-word special case is that of pointers to calldata lookup types;
see the section on <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-calldata-in-detail-pointers-to-calldata-from-the-stack>pointers to calldata from the
stack</a> for details.</p>
<p><a name=user-content-locations-in-detail-the-stack-in-detail-the-stack-data-layout></a></p>
<h4 id=the-stack-data-layout>
The stack: Data layout
<a class=anchor href=#the-stack-data-layout>#</a>
</h4>
<p>Stack variables are local variables, so naturally things will change as the
contract executes. But, we can still describe how things are at any given
time. Note that if you are actually writing a debugger, you may want to rely
on other systems to determine data layout on the stack.</p>
<p>The stack is of course not used only for storing local variables, but also as a
working space. And of course it also holds return addresses. The stack is
divided into stackframes; each stackframe begins with the return address.
(There is no frame pointer, for those used to such a thing; just a return
address.) The exceptions are constructors and fallback/receive functions, which do not
include a return address. In addition, if the initial function call (i.e.
stackframe) of the EVM stackframe (i.e. message call or creation call) is not a
constructor, and the contract has external functions other than the constructor,
fallback, and receive functions, then
the function selector will be stored on the stack below the first
stackframe. (Additionally, in Solidity 0.4.20 and later, an extra zero word
will appear below that on the stack if you&rsquo;re within a library call, unless the
function called is <code>pure</code> or <code>view</code> and does not include any storage pointers
in its input or output parameters.)</p>
<p>Note that function modifiers and base constructor invocations (whether placed
on the constructor or on the contract) do not create new stackframes; these are
part of the same stackframe as the function that invoked them.</p>
<p>Within each stackframe, all variables are always stored below the workspace. So
while the workspace may be unpredictable, we can ignore it for the purposes of
data layout within a given stackframe. (Of course, the workspace in one
stackframe does come between that stackframe&rsquo;s variables and the start of the
next stackframe.)</p>
<p>Restricting our attention to the variables, then, the stack acts, as expected,
as a stack; variables are pushed onto it when needed, and are popped off of it
when no longer needed. These pushes and pops are arranged in a way that is
compatible with the stack structure; i.e., they are in fact pushes and pops.</p>
<p>The parameters of the function being called, including output parameters, are
pushed onto the stack when the function is called and the stackframe is
entered, and are not popped until the function, <em>including all modifiers</em>,
exits. It&rsquo;s necessary here to specify the order they go onto the stack. First
come the input parameters, in the order they were given, followed by the output
parameters, in the order they were given. Anonymous output parameters are
treated the same as named output parameters for these purposes. Similarly,
parameters for fallback functions are not treated specially here, but work
like any other parameters.</p>
<p><em>Remark</em>: Yul functions work slightly differently here, in that output parameters
are pushed onto the stack in the <em>reverse</em> of the order they were given.</p>
<p>Ordinary local variables, as declared in a function or modifier, are pushed
onto the stack at their declaration and are popped when their containing block
exits (for variables declared in the initializer of a <code>for</code> loop, the
containing block is considered to be the <code>for</code> loop). If multiple variables
are declared within a single statement, they go on the stack in the order they
were declared within that statement.</p>
<p>Parameters to a modifier are pushed onto the stack when that modifier begins
and are popped when that modifier exits. Again, they go in the stack in the
order they were given. Note that (like other local variables declared in
modifiers) these variables are still on the stack while the placeholder
statement <code>_;</code> is running, even if they are inaccessible. Remember that
modifiers are run in order from left to right, and that they may be applied
to constructors, fallback functions, and receive functions.</p>
<p>This leaves the case of parameters to base constructor invocations (whether on
the constructor or on the contract). When a constructor is called, not only
are its parameters pushed onto the stack, but so are all the parameters to all
of its base constructors &ndash; not just the direct parents, but for all ancestors.
They go on in order from most derived to most base, as determined by the usual
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization>C3 order</a>
(discussed more in the <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-storage-in-detail-storage-data-layout>section on storage layout below</a>). Note that if
the base constructors are listed on the constructor declaration, the order has
no effect; only the order that the base classes are listed on the class
declaration matters here. Within each base constructor&rsquo;s parameter region, the
parameters are pushed on in order from left to right. Constructors then
execute in order from most base to most derived (again, note that the order
they&rsquo;re listed on the constructor declaration has no effect); when a
constructor exits, its parameters are popped from the stack. Modifiers on a
constructor or base constructor are handled when that constructor or base
constructor runs.</p>
<p>Paramters to a modifier on a fallback or receive function work like parameters
to a modifier on any other function. Note that parameters to a modifier on a
constructor only go onto the stack when that particular constructor is about to
run (i.e., all base constructors that run before it have exited).</p>

anywhere in the code, either! Immutables are simply inlined into the code
wherever they&rsquo;re read from, so if they&rsquo;re never read from, their value isn&rsquo;t
actually stored anywhere.</p>
<p>Note that code has no notion of &ldquo;slots&rdquo;; the variables are simply placed wherever
the compiler places them, among the code.</p>

<p><sup>[ <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail>∧</a> <em>Back to Locations in Detail</em> ]</sup></p>
<p>Memory is used in two different ways. Its ordinary use is to hold variables
declared as living in memory. Its secondary use, however, is to hold
immutables during contract construction.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t discuss layout in memory in the first context, since, as mentioned, we
only access it via pointers. However, we will discuss layout in memory for the
case of immutables in memory.</p>
<p><em>Remark</em>: Although memory objects ordinarily start on a word, there is a bug in
versions 0.5.3, 0.5.5, and 0.5.6 of Solidity specifically that can occasionally cause them to
start in the middle of a word. In this case, for the purposes of decoding that
object, you should consider slots to begin at the beginning of that object. (Of
course, once you follow a pointer, you&rsquo;ll have to have your slots based on that
pointer. Again, since we only access memory through pointers, this is mostly
not a concern, and it only happens at all in those specific versions of Solidity.)</p>

<h4 id=memory-direct-types-and-pointer-types>
Memory: Direct types and pointer types

<p>Memory is a <a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-direct-types-basics-of-direct-types-packing-and-padding>padded location</a>, so
direct types are padded as <a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-direct-types-table-of-direct-types>described in their table</a>.
Pointers, as mentioned above, always take up a full word.</p>
<p><strong>Note that prior to Solidity 0.8.9</strong>, immutables stored in memory had unusual
padding; they were always zero-padded on the right, regardless of their usual
padding. Again, note that this only applied to immutables stored directly in
memory during contract construct, and not to direct types appearing as elements
of another type in memory in memory&rsquo;s normal use. Since Solidity 0.8.9, all
direct types stored in memory, including immutables, have had normal padding.</p>

<h4 id=layout-of-immutables-in-memory>
Layout of immutables in memory
<a class=anchor href=#layout-of-immutables-in-memory>#</a>
</h4>
<p>Immutable state variables are stored in memory during contract construction.
(Or at least, for most of it; towards the end of contract construction memory
will be overwritten by the code of the contract being constructed.)</p>
<p>Immutable state variables are stored one after the other starting at memory
address <code>0x80</code> (skipping the first four words of memory as Solidity reserves
these for internal purposes). Memory being a padded location, each takes up
one word (although note that as per the <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-memory-in-detail-memory-direct-types-and-pointer-types>previous
subsection</a>,
the padding on immutables was unusual prior to Solidity 0.8.9). This just leaves the question of the
order that they are stored in.</p>
<p>For the simple case of a contract without inheritance, the immutable state
variables are stored in the order that they are declared. In the case of
inheritance, the variables of the base class go before those of the derived
class. In cases of multiple inheritance, Solidity uses the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization>C3
linearization</a> to order classes
from &ldquo;most base&rdquo; to &ldquo;most derived&rdquo;, and then, as mentioned above, lays out
variables starting with the most base and ending with the most derived.
(Remember that, when listing parent classes, Solidity considers parents listed
<em>first</em> to be &ldquo;more base&rdquo;; as the <a href=https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/contracts.html#multiple-inheritance-and-linearization>Solidity docs
note</a>,
this is the reverse order from, say, Python.)</p>

<h4 id=memory-multivalue-types>
Memory: Multivalue types
<a class=anchor href=#memory-multivalue-types>#</a>
</h4>
<p>A multivalue type in memory is simply represented by concatenating together the
representation of its elements; with the exceptions that elements of reference
type (both multivalue and lookup types), other than mappings, are <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-memory-in-detail-pointers-to-memory>represented
as
pointers</a>.
(Also, prior to Solidity 0.7.0, elements of <code>mapping</code> type, as well as
(possibly multidimensional) arrays of such, were allowed in memory structs and
were simply omitted, as mappings cannot appear in memory.) As such, each
element (that isn&rsquo;t omitted) takes up exactly one word (because direct types
are padded and all reference types are stored as pointers). Elements of
structs go in the order they&rsquo;re specified in.</p>
<p>(Note that prior to Solidity 0.7.0 it was possible to have in memory a struct
that contains <em>only</em> mappings, and prior to 0.5.0, it was possible to have a
struct that was empty entirely, or a statically-sized array of length 0. Such
a struct or array doesn&rsquo;t really have a representation in memory, since in
memory it has zero length. Of course, since we only access memory through
pointers, if we are given a pointer to such a struct or array, we need not
decode anything, as all of the struct&rsquo;s elements have been omitted. The actual
location pointed to may contain junk and should be ignored.)</p>
<p>Note that it is possible to have circular structs &ndash; not just circular struct
types, but actual circular structs &ndash; in memory. This is not possible in any
other location.</p>
<p><a name=user-content-locations-in-detail-memory-in-detail-memory-lookup-types></a></p>
<h4 id=memory-lookup-types>
Memory: Lookup types
<a class=anchor href=#memory-lookup-types>#</a>
</h4>
<p>There are two lookup types that can go in memory: <code>type[]</code> and <code>bytes</code> (there is
also <code>string</code>, but <a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-lookup-types>we will not treat that separately from
<code>bytes</code></a>).</p>
<p>A dynamic array of type <code>type[]</code> is represented by a slot containing the length
of the array (call it <code>n</code>), followed immediately by the array itself,
represented just as if it were an array of type <code>type[n]</code>; see the <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-memory-in-detail-memory-multivalue-types>section
above</a>.</p>
<p>A <code>bytes</code> is represented by a slot containing the length of the bytestring,
followed by a sequence of slots containing the bytestring; the bytes in the
string are <em>not</em> individually padded, but rather are simply stored in sequence.
Since the last slot may not contain a full 32 bytes, it is zero-padded on the
right.</p>
<p><em>Remark</em>: In a few specific versions of Solidity, there is a bug that can cause
particular <code>bytes</code> and <code>string</code>s to lack the padding on the end, resulting in the alignment bug
<a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-memory-in-detail>mentioned above</a>.</p>

<h4 id=pointers-to-memory>
Pointers to memory
<a class=anchor href=#pointers-to-memory>#</a>
</h4>
<p>Pointers to memory are absolute and given in bytes. Since memory is padded, all
pointers will point to the start of a word and thus be a multiple of <code>0x20</code>.
(With the exception, <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-memory-in-detail>mentioned above</a>,
of some pointers in some specific versions of Solidity.)</p>
<p>The pointer <code>0x60</code> is something of a null pointer; it points to a reserved slot
which is always zero. By the previous section, this slot can therefore
represent any empty variable of lookup type in memory, and in fact it&rsquo;s used as
a default value for memory pointers of lookup type.</p>

<p>Calldata is largely the same as <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-memory-in-detail>memory</a>; so rather than
describing calldata from scratch, we will simply describe how it differs from
memory.</p>
<p>Importantly, we will use a different convention when talking about &ldquo;slots&rdquo; in
calldata; see the <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-calldata-in-detail-slots-in-calldata-and-the-offset>following subsection</a>.
(Although it&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> important, since, like with memory, we only access
calldata through pointers. You just don&rsquo;t want to find yourself surprised by
it.)</p>

<h4 id=slots-in-calldata-and-the-offset>
Slots in calldata and the offset
<a class=anchor href=#slots-in-calldata-and-the-offset>#</a>
</h4>
<p>The first four bytes of calldata are the function selector, and are not followed
by any padding. As such, in calldata, we consider words and slots to begin not
on the <a href=#user-content-locations-basics>usual word boundaries</a> (multiples of <code>0x20</code>) but
rather to begin offset by 4-bytes; &ldquo;slots&rdquo; in calldata will begin at bytes whose
address is congruent to <code>0x4</code> modulo <code>0x20</code>. (Since calldata is byte-based
rather than word-based, this offset is not disastrous like it would be in, say,
storage.)</p>
<p>Because we will only access calldata through pointers, this offset is not that
relevant, but it is worth noting.</p>
<p>Also note that in constructors, there is no 4-byte offset, but that&rsquo;s because in
constructors, calldata is empty (the special variable <code>msg.sig</code> is padded to
contain 4 zero bytes). Parameters passed to constructors actually go in <em>code</em>
rather than calldata &ndash; and are represented the same way but with a different
offset &ndash; but since we will only deal with them once they have been copied onto
the stack or into memory, we will ignore this.</p>

<a class=anchor href=#calldata-multivalue-and-lookup-types-reference-types>#</a>
</h4>
<p>In order to understand reference types in calldata, we need the distinction of
<em>static</em> and <em>dynamic</em> types that was <a href=#user-content-types-overview-terminology>introduced earlier</a>.</p>
<p>With that in hand, then, variables of reference type in calldata are stored
similarly to in memory (<a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-memory-in-detail-memory-multivalue-types>1</a>,
<a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-memory-in-detail-memory-lookup-types>2</a>), with the difference that any of their elements of
static reference type are <em>not</em> stored as pointers, but are simply stored
inline; so unlike in memory, elements may take up multiple words. Elements of
dynamic type are still stored as pointers (but see the <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-calldata-in-detail-pointers-to-calldata>section
below</a> about how those work).</p>
<p>Also, structs that contain mappings (or arrays of such) are entirely illegal in
calldata, unlike in memory where the mappings are simply omitted.</p>
<p><em>Remark</em>: Calldata variables were only introduced in Solidity 0.5.0, so it is
impossible to have variables of zero-element multivalue type in calldata;
however, it still may be worth noting for other purposes that in the underlying
encoding, such variables are omitted entirely in calldata (unlike in storage
where they still take up a single word, or memory where it varies).</p>

The special variable <code>msg.data</code>
<a class=anchor href=#the-special-variable-codemsgdatacode>#</a>
</h5>
<p>While I&rsquo;ve thus far avoided discussing special variables, it&rsquo;s worth pausing
here to discuss the special variable <code>msg.data</code>, the one special variable of
reference type. It is a <code>bytes calldata</code>. But it&rsquo;s not represented like other
variables of type <code>bytes calldata</code>, is it? It&rsquo;s not some location in calldata
with the number of bytes followed by the string of bytes; it simply <em>is</em> all of
calldata. Accesses to it are simply accesses to the string of bytes that is
calldata.</p>
<p>This raises the question: Given that calldata is of variable length, where is
the length of <code>msg.data</code> stored? The answer, of course, is that this length is
what is returned by the <code>CALLDATASIZE</code> instruction. This instruction could be
considered something of a special location, and indeed many of the Solidity
language&rsquo;s special <a href=https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/units-and-global-variables.html>globally available
variables</a>
are &ldquo;stored&rdquo; in such special locations, each with their own EVM opcode.</p>
<p>We have thus far ignored these special locations here and how they are encoded.
However, since <a href=https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/units-and-global-variables.html#block-and-transaction-properties>the variables kept in these other special
locations</a>
are all of type <code>uint256</code>, <code>address</code>, or <code>address payable</code>; these special locations are
word-based rather than byte-based (to the extent that distinction is meaningful
here); and values from these special locations will always be copied to the
(also word-based) stack before use, there is little to say about encoding in
these special locations. One could say that addresses are, as always,
zero-padded on the left, and that integers are, as always, stored in binary; and
these statements would be true in a sense, but also largely meaningless.</p>
<p>Anyway, none of this is really relevant here, so let&rsquo;s move on from this
digression and discuss pointers to calldata.</p>

<p>Pointers to calldata are different depending on whether they are from calldata
or from the stack; and pointers to calldata from the stack are different
depending on whether they point to a multivalue type or to a lookup type.</p>
<p>Note, by the way, that there is no need for any sort of
<a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-pointers-to-memory>null pointer</a> in calldata, and so no equivalent exists.
(Variables in calldata of lookup type may be empty, of course, but distinct
empty calldata variables are kept separate from another, not coalesced into a
single null location like in memory.)</p>

<p>Pointers to calldata from calldata are relative, though in a slightly unusual
manner. They are also given in bytes, but are relative not to the current
location, but rather to the <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-calldata-in-detail-calldata-multivalue-and-lookup-types-reference-types>structure they are a part
of</a> (since they never
stand alone.)</p>
<p>For pointers to calldata stored in variables of multivalue type, the pointer is
relative to the start of that containing variable.</p>
<p>For pointers to calldata stored in variables of lookup type, the pointer is
relative to the start of the list of elements, i.e., the word <em>after</em> the length.</p>
<p>Or, to put it differently, either way it is always relative to the start of the
list of elements it is contained in.</p>
<p>Note that pointers to calldata from calldata will always be multiples of <code>0x20</code>,
since calldata, like memory, is padded (and these pointers are relative rather
than absolute).</p>

calldata, though, the <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-calldata-in-detail-slots-in-calldata-and-the-offset>start of a word</a>
is congruent to <code>0x4</code> modulo <code>0x20</code>, rather than being a multiple of <code>0x20</code>.</p>
<p>Pointers to calldata lookup types from the stack take up two words on the stack
rather than just one. The bottom word is a pointer &ndash; absolute and given in
bytes &ndash; but points not to the word containing the length, but rather the start
of the content, i.e., the word after the length (as described in the section on

The sizes in bytes of the direct types can be found in the <a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-direct-types-table-of-direct-types>direct types
table</a>.</p>
<p>Storage is the one location other than the stack where we sometimes access
variables directly rather than through pointers, so we will begin by describing
data layout in storage.</p>
<p><a name=user-content-locations-in-detail-storage-in-detail-storage-data-layout></a></p>
<h4 id=storage-data-layout>
Storage: Data layout
<a class=anchor href=#storage-data-layout>#</a>
</h4>
<p>Storage is used to hold all state variables that are not declared <code>constant</code> or
<code>immutable</code>. In what follows, we ignore <code>constant</code> and <code>immutable</code> variables,
and look just at the ordinary state variables. (Variables declared <code>constant</code>
are optimized out by the compiler; variables declared <code>immutable</code> are stored in
<a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-code-in-detail-code-data-layout>code</a> or <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-memory-in-detail-layout-of-immutables-in-memory>memory</a> instead.)</p>
<p>First, we consider the case of a contract that does not inherit from any others.</p>
<p>In this case, state variables in storage are always laid out in the order that they were declared,
starting from the beginning of storage. However, within a word, variables are
laid out from <em>right to left</em>, not left to right (with one sort-of-exception to
be <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-storage-in-detail-storage-lookup-types>described later</a>). Variables of direct type may not
cross a word boundary; if there is not enough room left at the top of a word for
what comes next, the unused space at the top of the word remains filled with
zeroes, and the next variable starts at the bottom of the next word.</p>
<p>Note that this right-to-left orientation does not mean that the representations
of direct types themselves are in any way reversed, only the order they&rsquo;re laid
out in within a word.</p>
<p>Vaiables of lookup type are, for this purpose, regarded as taking up one word;
see the <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-storage-in-detail-storage-lookup-types>subsection on lookup types</a> for more
information.</p>
<p>Variables of multivalue type must start on a word boundary, and always occupy
whole words (i.e. the next variable after must start on a word boundary).</p>
<p>As mentioned above, variables declared <code>constant</code> or <code>immutable</code> are skipped.</p>
<p>Subject to the above restrictions, every variable is placed as early as
possible.</p>
<p>Now, we consider inheritance.</p>
<p>In cases of inheritance, the variables of the base class go before those of the
derived class. Note that there is <em>not</em> any sort of barrier between the
variables of the base class and those of the derived class; variables of the
base class and variables of the derived class may share a slot (so the first
variable of the derived class need not start on a slot boundary).</p>
<p>In cases of multiple inheritance, Solidity uses the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization>C3
linearization</a> to order classes
from &ldquo;most base&rdquo; to &ldquo;most derived&rdquo;, and then, as mentioned above, lays out
variables starting with the most base and ending with the most derived.
(Remember that, when listing parent classes, Solidity considers parents listed
<em>first</em> to be &ldquo;more base&rdquo;; as the <a href=https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/contracts.html#multiple-inheritance-and-linearization>Solidity docs
note</a>,
this is the reverse order from, say, Python.)</p>
<p><a name=user-content-locations-in-detail-storage-in-detail-storage-direct-types></a></p>
<h4 id=storage-direct-types>
Storage: Direct types
<a class=anchor href=#storage-direct-types>#</a>
</h4>
<p>The layout of direct types has already been described
<a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-storage-in-detail-storage-data-layout>above</a>, and the sizes of the direct types are found in the
<a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-direct-types-table-of-direct-types>direct types table</a>. Note that there are <a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-pointer-types>no pointer
types in storage</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note that in Solidity 0.8.8</strong>, there was a bug that caused user-defined value
types to always take up a full word in storage, regardless of the size of the
underlying type; values of these types would be padded as normal.</p>
<p><a name=user-content-locations-in-detail-storage-in-detail-storage-multivalue-types></a></p>
<h4 id=storage-multivalue-types>
Storage: Multivalue types
<a class=anchor href=#storage-multivalue-types>#</a>
</h4>
<p>Variables of multivalue type simply have the elements stored consecutively
within storage &ndash; they are packed within the multivalue type <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-storage-in-detail-storage-data-layout>just as variables
are packed within storage</a>. The rules are exactly the same.</p>
<p>The one exceptions is that (in pre-0.5.0 versions of Solidity where this was
legal) multivalue types with zero elements still take up a single word, rather
than zero words. (So, for instance, a <code>uint[2][0]</code> takes up 1 word, and a
<code>bytes1[0][3]</code> takes up 3 words.)</p>
<p>Again, remember that variables of multivalue type must occupy whole words; they
start on a word boundary, and whatever comes after starts on a word boundary
too. And, obviously, this applies to variables of multivalue type <em>within</em>
another variable of multivalue type since, as mentioned, the rules are exactly
the same. (But I thought that case was worth highlighting.)</p>
<p><a name=user-content-locations-in-detail-storage-in-detail-storage-lookup-types></a></p>
<h4 id=storage-lookup-types>
Storage: Lookup types
<a class=anchor href=#storage-lookup-types>#</a>
</h4>
<p>There are three lookup types that can go in storage: <code>type[]</code>, <code>bytes</code> (and
<code>string</code>, but <a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-lookup-types>again we will not treat that
separately</a>), and <code>mapping(keyType => elementType)</code>.</p>
<p>As <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-storage-in-detail-storage-data-layout>mentioned above</a>, we regard each lookup type as taking
up one word; we will call this the &ldquo;main word&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For <code>type[]</code>, i.e. an array, the main word contains the length of the array.
Suppose the main word is in slot <code>p</code> and the length it contains is <code>n</code>. Then
the array itself is stored exactly as if it were an array of type <code>type[n]</code>
(<a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-storage-in-detail-storage-multivalue-types>see section above</a>), except that it starts in the
slot <code>keccak256(p)</code>.</p>
<p>(Yes, that is the <em>position</em> being used; no explicit pointer to the array
location is stored. Other lookup types will be similar in this regard.)</p>
<p>For <code>bytes</code>, if the length (call it <code>n</code>) is less than 32, the low byte of the
main word contains <code>n&lt;&lt;1</code>, and the string of bytes itself is stored in the same
word, in sequence from <em>left to right</em>; any unused space within the word is left
as zero.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the length <code>n</code> is at least 32, then the low byte of the
main word contains <code>(n&lt;&lt;1)|0x1</code>, and the string of bytes is stored starting in
the slot <code>keccak256(p)</code>, where <code>p</code> is the position of the main word. This
bytestring, too, goes from <em>left to right</em> within words, but (like an array) can
take up as many words as necessary. Again, any unused space left within the
last word is left as zero.</p>
<p>(Type <code>bytes</code> (and <code>string</code>) is the one sort-of-exception I mentioned to the
<a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-storage-in-detail-storage-data-layout>right-to-left rule within storage</a>.)</p>
<p>Finally, we have mappings. For mappings, the main word itself is unused and
left as zero; only its position <code>p</code> is used. Mappings, famously, do not store
what keys exist; keys that don&rsquo;t exist and keys whose corresponding element is
<code>0</code> (which is always the encoding of the default value
(<a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-direct-types-table-of-direct-types>1</a>, <a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-multivalue-types>2</a>,
<a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-lookup-types>3</a>, <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-storage-in-detail-storage-multivalue-types>4</a>,
<a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-storage-in-detail-storage-lookup-types>5</a>) for anything in storage) are treated the same.</p>
<p>For a mapping <code>map</code> and a key <code>key</code>, then, the element <code>map[key]</code> is stored
starting at <code>keccak256(key . p)</code>, where <code>.</code> represents concatenation and <code>key</code>
here has been converted to a string of bytes &ndash; something that is meaningful
for every <a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-lookup-types>key type</a>.
For the key types which are direct, the padded form
is used; the value can be converted to a string of bytes by the representations
listed in the <a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-direct-types-representations-of-direct-types>section on direct types</a>,
with the padding as listed in the <a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-direct-types-table-of-direct-types>direct types table</a>;
for the lookup key type <code>bytes</code> (<a href=#user-content-types-overview-overview-of-the-types-lookup-types>and <code>string</code></a>),
well, this by itself represents a string of bytes! (No padding is applied to
these.) Similarly, the position <code>p</code> is regarded as a 32-byte unsigned integer,
because that is how storage locations are accessed.</p>
<p>Note that if an element of a mapping is of direct type, this means it will
always start on a slot boundary, even if it doesn&rsquo;t normally have to. In any
case, regardless of type, the element is stored <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-storage-in-detail>exactly the same as it would be
anywhere else in storage</a>.</p>
<p><a name=user-content-locations-in-detail-storage-in-detail-pointers-to-storage></a></p>
<h4 id=pointers-to-storage>
Pointers to storage
<a class=anchor href=#pointers-to-storage>#</a>
</h4>
<p>Pointers to storage are absolute and are measured in words (slots), not bytes.
(Such pointers are most easily regarded as pointing to the full slot, rather
than a byte position within it; if you like, though, you can imagine it pointing
to the <em>latest</em> position within the word, rather than the earliest, in
accordance with the <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-storage-in-detail-storage-multivalue-types>right-to-left nature of storage multivalue
types</a>, and the <a href=#user-content-locations-in-detail-storage-in-detail-storage-lookup-types>use of the low
byte</a> in types <code>bytes</code> and <code>string</code>.) This might seem to
limit the locations such a pointer can point to; however, pointers to storage
will always point to a variable of multivalue or lookup type, and such variables
always start on a word boundary, so there is no problem here.</p>
<p>Note that pointers to storage have a default value of <code>0x0</code>. As stated earlier,
one must beware &ndash; making use of such a pointer <em>can</em> lead to nonsense! Such a
pointer should not actually be used. (And note again that while it is legal to
leave a storage pointer uninitialized, it is not legal to delete one.)</p>
