# Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic

Finally, a brief word on a favorite example of advocates of private control over
money issuance, the German hyperinflation of 1923, which was supposedly caused by
excessive government money printing. The Reichsbank president at the time,
Hjalmar Schacht, putthe record straight on the real causes of that episode in
Schacht (1967). Specifically, in May 1922 the Allies insisted on granting total
private control over the Reichsbank. Thisprivate institution then allowed
private banks to issue massive amounts of currency, until half the money in
circulation was private bank money that the Reichsbank readily exchanged for
Reichsmarks on demand. The private Reichsbank also enabled speculators
short-sell the currency, which was already under severe pressure due to the
transfer problem of the reparations payments pointed out by Keynes (1929).21It
did so by granting lavish Reichsmark loans to speculators on demand, which they
could exchange for foreign currency when forward sales of Reichsmarks matured.
When Schacht was appointed, in late 1923, he stopped converting private monies to
Reichsmark on demand,he stopped granting Reichsmark loans on demand, and
furthermore he made the new Rentenmark non-convertible against foreign
currencies. The result was that speculators were crushed and the hyperinflation
was stopped. Further support for the currency came from the Dawes plan that
significantly reduced unrealistically high reparations payments.This episode can
therefore clearly not be blamed on excessive money printing by a government-run
central bank, but rather on a combination of excessive reparations claims and of
massive money creation by private speculators, aided and abetted by a
private central bank.
