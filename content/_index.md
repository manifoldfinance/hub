using OpenMEVs backend platform to provide trade execution services to end users.

```typescript
/**
* @package OpenMEV Ethereum Provider Example
* @summary Provides RPC Connectivity to DApps/Wallets
*  connects to multiple RPC endpoints
* @tldr: openmev aggregates multiple MEV protection solutions, seamlessly.
* @since 2021.09

import { Wallet } from "@ethersproject/wallet";
import * as providers from "@ethersproject/providers";
import { OpenMEVBundleProvider } from "@OpenMEV/sdk-ethers-provider";
// (...)
```

security bulletin discussing the impact and credit the discoverer.
